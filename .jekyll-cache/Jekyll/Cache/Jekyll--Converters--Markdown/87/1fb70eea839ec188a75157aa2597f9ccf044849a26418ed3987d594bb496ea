I"t<p>The fourth week is already over, and we have been busy with the Line-up. A line-up is a minute-by-minute overview of the most important segments of our format. We went to see what a suitable line-up would be for our concept. This is part of the prototype phase from Design Thinking because we were experimenting with the appropriate times, and we tried to see an opportunity in this. We also worked on the debrief, format description, budget, and contact info. In the concept book we went deeper into the idea, the programme, the segments and the USP. It also contains conclusions from the analyzed podcasts. Of these, we have described semiotics, cinematography, genre, and narrative. I was allowed to present the line-up. This was useful so that we could get feedback on this. This fits in with the test phase from Design Thinking because we ask for feedback and therefore also involve stakeholders. We were very curious about what the others thought of this. We received useful feedback and we were able to process this feedback again. This is part of the implementation phase because this feedback allowed us to look back at our work with a critical eye. This also allows us to identify points for development. In the beginning I found it a bit unclear what we all had to make, but over time this became more and more clear. I’m happy with the result and I’m open to any feedback.</p>
