I"€<p>In the second week we entered the explore phase of Design Thinking, this is phase 1. The explore phase includes the ideate phase and the prototype phase. In the second week we have been working on the 5liners. We first received an explanation for this during the online lecture via Blackboard. I liked those examples were given, so I understood exactly what was meant by a 5liner. My group and I held individual brainstorming sessions and then worked on our 5liner. There were very nice ideas, but with some we had to think carefully whether they were feasible. This is part of the Ideate phase of Design Thinking because we are busy coming up with different possibilities. We had to think out of the box and be creative. We pitched our 5liners to each other and gave each other feedback. This is also part of the Prototype phase because we went to see if the different ideas could be possibilities for our concept. You must think inventively for this. I really liked our working method because it gave me enough time to fully focus. Then we had time to assess each other. Iâ€™m satisfied with the result and Iâ€™m glad I learned something new.</p>
