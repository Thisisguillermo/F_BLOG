I"ê<p>In the seventh week we wanted to start filming and we did. We had picked up the cameras and then we filmed the skit in the Chancellery. It had to be a kind of first date setting, so I brought a white cloth, wine glasses, rose petals and a table candle. This went very smoothly, and we still had enough time to continue filming with our second part of the vodcast. We did this in the studio at school itself. We had everything ready, and we were satisfied with the result. This is part of the prototype phase because we were literally making our prototype. We experimented with the images. We looked at which would be suitable, and which would not. Silke and I then took charge of the panel talk and before that we had called Afke van der Woud to talk about our main question. Afke van der Woud is the research teacher. After approval of the main question, we started developing the interview guide. After this we invited Frisian friends for the panel talk. On Thursday everyone came to the Chancellery, and we had the panel talk. This was a lot of fun to do and very interesting. We have received useful feedback that we can certainly use. We will now take this feedback on board, but also for the next period. During the panel talk I took on the role of Assistant recorder. I paid attention to the behavior of the Frisian youth, and I added questions to make sure that the main question could be answered clearly. This is part of the test phase, because we involve stakeholders, and we look at what the target group thinks of our prototype.</p>

<p>After the second phase, we gave each other feedback again via feedback fruits. After this we went to the evaluation phase.</p>
