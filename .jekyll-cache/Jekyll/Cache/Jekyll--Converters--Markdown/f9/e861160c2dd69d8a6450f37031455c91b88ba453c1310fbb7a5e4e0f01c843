I"á<p>In the last week we had the boardroom pitch on Monday. Unfortunately, I couldnâ€™t be physically present, but luckily, I was online. I helped with the preparation and during the pitch I was the secretary. I was also able to give the others enough tips to help them. I really enjoy presenting/pitching. I was therefore very sorry that I could not physically be there. I have taken up the role as a note taker and I have recorded all feedback. We can take this with us to the next module. The clients were very enthusiastic and curious about the result. Thatâ€™s why we got a â€˜Goâ€™! I am very happy with this, and I am also looking forward to the next module. This belongs to the test phase and the implementation phase, because</p>
