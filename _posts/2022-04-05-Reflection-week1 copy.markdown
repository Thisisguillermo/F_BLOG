The first week was mainly about understanding the assignment and forming groups. This is the Understand phase of the Design Thinking model. The Understand phase includes the empatize phase and the define phase. I write my reflection based on the STARR method. (Benders, 2021)


The first week of the Concept module started on January 31, 2022. On Monday we started with an online kick-off via Blackboard from Sonny Prent. It was explained here what the module assignment was and what was expected of the students. The students had to analyze existing media platforms and content. First, I checked for myself what exactly the assignment was. Before that, I re-watched the kick-off again. So, I could let this sink in for a while. This is part of the Empathize phase of Design Thinking. In this phase you delve into the question, and you look for existing knowledge. My first impression was very good, and I am very curious. In the Empathize phase, you also put aside your own assumptions. It was also recommended to keep abreast of the latest (media) trends every week.

In this way I could gain inspiration. I have therefore also made two photo collages based on sources. The first photo collage is about the most used apps in 2022 and the other photo collage is about the latest trends of 2022. This belongs to the Define phase of Design Thinking. You will analyze information and immerse yourself in various sources. It is important that you are focused. This also worked for me, because I got such good insight into what the latest (media) trends were. During the first workshops, the students introduced each other, and we immediately formed groups. Later in the afternoon we had a partner meeting. Here we could choose for which client we wanted to make the assignment. I briefly noted what each client stands for. During the first workshops, the students introduced each other, and we immediately formed groups. My first impression was very good, and I am very curious. I'm open to it and I let it all come to me.
