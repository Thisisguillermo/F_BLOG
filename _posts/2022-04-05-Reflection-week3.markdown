This is the third week and after following our lecture we started working on the concept flyers. We have studied the W/T, Form and Duration in depth. In addition, I have been working on my essay. We analyzed two podcasts, of which I analyzed the genre bit. We have formed the conclusions of the different parts into one conclusion. We also started making our flyers. I've always had doubts about the design, but luckily, we had Yung Frysk's house style. We used the format of concept flyers and explained the premise, concept, storytelling, key moments and USPs of our ideas. After we were all done with our flyers, we gave each other feedback and made a top three. This is part of the Prototype phase because we try to see which concept idea is possible and which is not. We try to concretize this based on questions. In the end we chose the idea "Op its RÃ¢ndsje". I also really liked the flyer that came with it. We took a critical look at the flyer to see if anything needed to be changed. In the workshops we received feedback on the flyer, and we were able to process this again. This is part of the Implementation phase of Design Thinking because you look critically at a product and also reflect on it. You decide the sequel and you try to look ahead. I thought it went well, but I found it difficult to make nice flyers. I always think long and hard about how I want to shape it, because I'm a bit of a perfectionist.
