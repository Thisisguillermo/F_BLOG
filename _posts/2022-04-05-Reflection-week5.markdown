In the fifth week of 07-03-2022 we had many online lectures via Blackboard, in which Sonny Prent explained information about the Proof of concept (POC). The POC is a media product prototype (or sizzle reel) or concept (max. 5 min.) in which USP is evident. We started by making the Proof of concept. We have chosen to make a vodcast. At the beginning of the vodcast we show a short skit. I also worked on the concept book. In the concept book I have been working on further developing the segments. I had to think carefully about what kind of creative segments we want to add in the video. This is part of the prototype phase because you must make concrete and come up with possibilities. We also assessed each other's writings and gave each other feedback. We have processed the feedback given for the line-up. This is part of the test phase because we ask each other for feedback and work practically.
