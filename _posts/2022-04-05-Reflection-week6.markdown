In the following week, we continued with the concept book. We had almost everything finished, only the last things still had to be done. Miriam and I continued with the Proof of concept. We also made a list of what we still had to arrange for the filming. Later in the week I went to the Action and bought stuff for the layout of the setting where we were going to film. This is not part of the Design Thinking phase, but I am busy preparing the video.
