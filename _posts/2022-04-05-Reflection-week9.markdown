In the last week we had the boardroom pitch on Monday. Unfortunately, I couldn't be physically present, but luckily, I was online. I helped with the preparation and during the pitch I was the secretary. I was also able to give the others enough tips to help them. I really enjoy presenting/pitching. I was therefore very sorry that I could not physically be there. I have taken up the role as a note taker and I have recorded all feedback. We can take this with us to the next module. The clients were very enthusiastic and curious about the result. That's why we got a 'Go'! I am very happy with this, and I am also looking forward to the next module.

I have also been busy with the last things for our concept book and my individual portfolio. I have made a website for my individual portfolio with this reflection. It also contains the assignments 5W+1H and my essay. This is part of the test phase and the implementation phase because we involved stakeholders, in this case our clients. We received feedback during the test phase. They also identified areas for development. This is part of the implementation phase. They looked critically at our concept, and we looked ahead to see what could be done better in the next module.
