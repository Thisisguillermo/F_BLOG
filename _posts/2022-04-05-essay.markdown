**Genre theory**

You can classify different things into different types of genres. The definition of genre is class, kind, or type. You can categorize different things into genres through the classification system. This is possible with bears, for example, because you have different types of bears. There is a panda bear, a brown bear, or a black bear. These all fall under the 'bear' genre. This is less easy with media products, because there is a lot of overlap within the sub-distributions. As a result, products often belong to multiple genres, or the genres therefore shift very quickly. People can also differ when it comes to a genre. It is more difficult to make a division of genres within media products than with bears. "No set of necessary and sufficient conditions can delineate genres of other kinds in a way that all pundits or casual moviegoers would find acceptable." *(David Bordwell, 1989).*

**Codes and conventions**

“Genre enables the communication of content. Communication is impossible without the agreed codes of the genre”. (Alastrain Fowler, 1989). Everything we do with media products has to do with communicating and getting a message across. The language also has rules. You cannot communicate or transfer content if you do not know the codes. Genre can also be seen as language. If one knows the codes and conventions of genres, then one also understands how and why media products affect their audience.

**Genre rules**

There are technical, formal, and semiotic rules. These rules are about how the product looks, is put together and about the form that the product takes. They are unwritten rules. With posters you already get an idea about a product. Formal in this sense means: Focused on internal structure, the (technical) choices regarding how the product is put together. This concerns, for example, certain techniques, instruments, and cameras (Franco Fabbi, 1980).

There are also rules of conduct and social rules. It has to do with social image which is linked to a certain genre. Some actions are accepted in one genre, but not in another. Genres are also sometimes associated with certain social groups such as class, ethnicity, and gender (Franco Fabbi, 1980).

Commercial rules concern the 'maker' of a product, the person who earns money from it. They are rules that have to do with how it is sold (Franco Fabbi, 1980).

**Concept**

The Frisian youth is standing in the middle of their personoal developent. The ones who can speak Frisian are nowadays ashamed of their second language. Our job is to make the frisian language modern and give the Frisian youth the feeling that they don’t need to be ashamed. The survery showed that by the question ‘Name three things that are important to you’ every respondent named her/his family. That means that family is important for Frisian youngsters. This includes the next question ‘What does the Frisian language mean to you?’ where there were answers as ‘home’ or ‘It is my culture and feels like home’. Frisian youngsters link their language to the warm and familliar feeling of home. That is why we came up with the idea ‘Op it Rântsje.’ Everyone comes to the dinner table and thinks of what he or she can say twice. the dinnertable is a place where families come togheter or where you catch up with your friends. It is also a place where you respect each other's norms and values. Yet youngsters are honest and brutal, which could lead to discussion about what is normal at your own dinner table.

A Frisian vodcast that talks about topics and statements that you can or cannot say at the dinnertable by your mother-in-law. It is a striking and entertaining series that hopefully makes more Frisian youngsters proud of their language.

Two Frisian students between 16-20 year old are hosting the series with a different guest each episode. There are two to three statements or topics per episode, and a different location each episode. Also the setting of the show changes with the location. The statements are being categorised in Absolutely not, on the edge, it’s not okay.

**The Supergaande Podcast**

**The Man, man, man podcast**

Man, man, man the podcast is a podcast by Chris Bergström, Bas Louissen and Domien Verschuuren. Every week they make a podcast of about 45 minutes with a specific theme.

**Codes and conventions comedy**

n the comedy genre, people in a podcast are usually socially awkward, clumsy/accident prone and sarcastic characters. They can embarrass themselves, which is humorous to the audience. Much use is made of instrumental music tracks without vocals. The music that is used usually provides a 'relaxed' effect and the music is not louder than the speech. The music must consider the target audience. Silence would be best used when there is and end of a section or scene. If we look at the storytelling of the narrative, we mainly see that there are two or more presenters discussing a theme. This usually has a chronological structure. Majority of the characters are presented as sharing the same social status, with no character looking more superior and dominant than others. Non-diegetic sound is often incorporated to emphasize. Audio logo aural mix used on its own to identify. Intro musical welcome/initial credits.
